# Mathematical Optimization

## Description

This project is an implementation of the [Miller, Tucker and Zemlin (MTZ) model](http://quanscope.com/TSP_MTZ.pdf) to solve the [Travelling salesman problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem).

The implementation of the model is written in the file [solve.py](/solve.py).

For more information about the model, solving process and results checkout the [report](/relatorioProgmat.pdf).
